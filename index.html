        <h3>Hikkaduwa Turtle Hatchery</h3>
        <p>
          The Hikkaduwa Turtle Hatchery in Sri Lanka is a conservation center focused on safeguarding sea turtles. It offers a protected space for turtle eggs to hatch and for young turtles to develop before their release into the ocean.
          
          Additionally, the hatchery serves as a rehabilitation facility for injured turtles, conducts research, and runs educational programs to promote sea turtle conservation. Visitors can learn about Sri Lanka's turtle species, their challenges,
          
          and actively participate in releasing baby turtles into the sea.

        <h3>Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery</h3>
        <p>
          The Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery in Sri Lanka, established in 1981 by the Sri Lanka Wildlife Protection Society, is dedicated to protecting and conserving sea turtles.
          
          It provides a safe space for sea turtle eggs to hatch and for baby turtles to grow before their release into the ocean. The hatchery also serves as a rehabilitation center for injured turtles and conducts research and educational programs.
          
          Visitors can learn about Sri Lanka's turtle species, the hatchery's efforts, and participate in releasing baby turtles into the ocean.

        <h3>Bentota Turtle Hatchery</h3>
        <p>
          The Bentota Turtle Hatchery in Sri Lanka is a conservation center established in 1986. It protects sea turtle eggs and facilitates the growth of baby turtles before their release.
          
          The hatchery also rehabilitates injured turtles, conducts research, and promotes conservation through education. Visitors can learn about Sri Lanka's turtle species, the hatchery's efforts,
          
          and participate in releasing baby turtles.

        <h3>Turtles navigate using Earth's magnetic field</h3>
        <img src="Images/Turtle-findings1.jpg" alt="Turtle Findings 2">
        <p>
          Researchers from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill conducted a study on loggerhead turtles' navigation abilities. The findings indicate that these turtles use the Earth's magnetic field to navigate,
          
          even when the magnetic fields are artificially altered. The turtles utilize the magnetic field as a reference point, helping them determine their position and orientation. This discovery has significant implications for conservation efforts,
          
          enabling scientists to protect sea turtles and their habitats better. Understanding their navigation mechanisms can aid in safeguarding critical habitats and migration routes, mitigating human-induced threats like habitat destruction and fishing gear entanglement.
          
          The study offers compelling evidence of loggerhead turtles' impressive navigational skills, shedding light on the intricate mechanisms enabling animals to traverse vast distances.

        <h3>Turtle fossil reveals evolution secrets</h3>
        <img src="Images/Turtle-findings2.jpg" alt="Turtle Findings 1">
        <p>
          The recent discovery of the fossil Eorhynchochelys sinensis in China sheds light on turtle evolution. This transitional form, dating back 150 million years,
          
          exhibits a beak-like structure and a partially formed shell. It suggests that turtles developed their beaks before their shells and that they are more closely related to birds and crocodiles than to lizards and snakes.
          
          The fossil indicates a gradual evolution of the protective shell over time. This finding fills gaps in the fossil record and enhances our understanding of turtle relationships with other reptiles.
          
          It emphasizes the importance of preserving fossils and exploring nature for a deeper comprehension of Earth's biological history. In summary, this discovery marks a significant milestone, challenging previous assumptions and providing fresh insights into the origins of unique turtle characteristics.
