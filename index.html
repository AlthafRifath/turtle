        <h3>Hikkaduwa Turtle Hatchery</h3>
        <p>
          The Hikkaduwa Turtle Hatchery is a conservation center located in the town of Hikkaduwa, Sri Lanka, dedicated to the protection and preservation of sea turtles.

          The hatchery provides a safe environment for turtle eggs to hatch and for baby turtles to grow before being released back into the ocean. The center also serves as a rehabilitation facility for injured and sick turtles,
                                
          and conducts research and educational programs to raise awareness about the importance of sea turtle conservation. Visitors to the hatchery can learn about the different species of turtles found in Sri Lanka and the threats they face,

          and even participate in releasing baby turtles into the ocean.

        <h3>Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery</h3>
        <p>
          The Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery is a conservation center located in the village of Kosgoda, Sri Lanka, dedicated to the protection and conservation of sea turtles.

          The hatchery was established in 1981 by the Sri Lanka Wildlife Protection Society and is one of several turtle hatcheries along the southern coast of Sri Lanka.

          The center's main objective is to protect sea turtle eggs and provide a safe environment for baby turtles to hatch and grow before being released into the ocean.
          The hatchery also serves as a rescue and rehabilitation center for injured and sick turtles and conducts research and educational programs to raise awareness about the importance of turtle conservation.
          
          Visitors to the hatchery can learn about the different species of turtles found in Sri Lanka and the hatchery's conservation efforts, and even participate in releasing baby turtles into the ocean.

        <p>
          The Bentota Turtle Hatchery is a conservation center located in the town of Bentota, Sri Lanka, dedicated to the preservation and protection of sea turtles.

          The hatchery was established in 1986 by a local community organization and is one of several turtle hatcheries along the southern coast of Sri Lanka.

          The center's primary objective is to protect sea turtle eggs and provide a safe environment for baby turtles to hatch and grow before being released into the ocean.

          The hatchery also serves as a rescue and rehabilitation center for injured and sick turtles and conducts research and educational programs to raise awareness about the importance of turtle conservation.

        <h3>Turtles navigate using Earth's magnetic field</h3>
        <img src="Images/Turtle-findings1.jpg" alt="Turtle Findings 2">
        <p>
          A recent study led by researchers from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has shed new light on the navigation abilities of loggerhead turtles.

          For years, scientists have suspected that turtles use the Earth's magnetic field to guide them across vast distances to their home beaches. 

          The study found that even when the magnetic fields around them were artificially altered, the turtles were still able to navigate using the Earth's magnetic field.

          The researchers also discovered that the turtles used the magnetic field as a "map" to orient themselves and determine their position relative to their goal.

          The ability to detect and respond to changes in the magnetic field was also observed in the turtles. The findings have important implications for conservation efforts aimed at protecting sea turtles and their habitats. 

          By understanding how these animals navigate, scientists may be able to better protect critical habitats and migration routes and reduce human-induced threats such as fishing gear entanglement and habitat destruction. 

          The study provides compelling evidence of the remarkable navigational abilities of these ancient creatures, shedding light on the complex mechanisms that allow animals to find their way across vast distances.

        <h3>Turtle fossil reveals evolution secrets</h3>
        <img src="Images/Turtle-findings2.jpg" alt="Turtle Findings 1">
        <p>
          The recent discovery of an ancient turtle fossil in China may help solve some of the mysteries surrounding turtle evolution. The fossil, named Eorhynchochelys sinensis, is a transitional form that lived around 150 million years ago.
          
          It has both a beak-like structure and a partially formed shell, providing evidence that turtles evolved their beaks before their shells. The beak also suggests that turtles are more closely related to birds and crocodiles than to lizards and snakes.
          
          The partially formed shell indicates that the hard, protective shell evolved gradually over time. The discovery of Eorhynchochelys sinensis helps fill gaps in the fossil record and provides new insights into the relationships between turtles and other reptiles.
          
          It highlights the importance of preserving fossils and continued exploration of the natural world, which can deepen our understanding of the history of life on Earth and the incredible diversity of species that have inhabited our planet over time.
          
          In conclusion, this discovery is a significant milestone in our understanding of turtle evolution, challenging previous assumptions and providing new insights into the origins of their unique features.
