      <h1>Threats to Turtles</h1>
      <p>Sea turtles face many threats to their survival, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Loss of nesting habitat due to development and erosion</li>
        <li>Predation of eggs and hatchlings by animals like raccoons and dogs</li>
        <li>Entanglement in fishing gear, such as nets and lines</li>
        <li>Ingestion of marine debris, like plastic bags and balloons, which can cause blockages in their digestive systems and death</li>
        <li>Overharvesting for their meat, shells, and eggs, which are considered delicacies in some cultures</li>
        <li>Climate change, which can affect sea turtle nesting patterns and the availability of food</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is important that we work to mitigate these threats to protect sea turtles and their habitats.</p>

      <h2>Conservation Efforts</h2>
      <p>Many organizations, including the Sri Lankan government and local hatcheries, are working to protect sea turtles and their habitats. Conservation efforts include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Protecting nesting habitats through laws and regulations</li>
        <li>Creating artificial nesting sites, like hatcheries, to protect eggs and hatchlings</li>
        <li>Developing fishing gear that is less likely to entangle sea turtles</li>
        <li>Conducting research to better understand sea turtle biology and behavior</li>
        <li>Educating the public about the importance of sea turtle conservation</li>
      </ul>
