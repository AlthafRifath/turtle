      <h1>Threats to Turtles</h1>
      <p>Sea turtles face many threats to their survival, including:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><h2>Loss of nesting habitat due to development and erosion</h2></li>
          <p>
            The loss of nesting habitat due to development and erosion poses a significant threat to sea turtles. As coastal areas face increasing human activity,
            
            the destruction and degradation of nesting beaches limit the turtles' ability to reproduce and perpetuate their populations. Conservation efforts are crucial in mitigating this risk and protecting their nesting sites.
          </p>
        <li><h2>Predation of eggs and hatchlings by animals like raccoons and dogs</h2></li>
          <p>
            Predation of eggs and hatchlings by animals like raccoons and dogs is a major threat to sea turtles. These animals are attracted to the eggs and hatchlings
            
            and can easily dig up nests and eat the eggs. Conservation efforts are crucial in mitigating this risk and protecting their nesting sites.
          </p>
        <li><h2>Entanglement in fishing gear, such as nets and lines</h2></li>

            Entanglement in fishing gear, such as nets and lines, is a major threat to sea turtles. These animals are attracted to the eggs and hatchlings

          </p>
        <li><h2>Ingestion of marine debris, like plastic bags and balloons, which can cause blockages in their digestive systems and death</h2></li>

            Overharvesting for their meat, shells, and eggs, which are considered delicacies in some cultures, is a major threat to sea turtles. These animals are attracted to the eggs and hatchlings
            
            and can easily dig up nests and eat the eggs. Conservation efforts are crucial in mitigating this risk and protecting their nesting sites.
          </p>

            Climate change, which can affect sea turtle nesting patterns and the availability of food, is a major threat to sea turtles. These animals are attracted to the eggs and hatchlings

      <h1>Conservation Efforts</h1>
      <p>Many organizations, including the Sri Lankan government and local hatcheries, are working to protect sea turtles and their habitats. Conservation efforts include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><h2>Protecting nesting habitats through laws and regulations</h2></li>
          <p>
            Protecting nesting habitats through laws and regulations is essential for the conservation of sea turtles. By establishing and enforcing measures that limit disturbances,
            
            coastal development, and habitat destruction, we can safeguard the crucial nesting sites. These protective measures ensure the continued survival and success of sea turtle populations for future generations.
          </p>
        <li><h2>Creating artificial nesting sites, like hatcheries, to protect eggs and hatchlings</h2></li>
