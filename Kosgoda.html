      <h2>Conservation Efforts</h2>
      <p>The Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery works to protect sea turtle populations in several ways, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Collecting and incubating turtle eggs</li>
          <p>
            By collecting and incubating turtle eggs, conservationists play a critical role in safeguarding sea turtle populations. This hands-on approach increases the survival rates of hatchlings and contributes to their long-term conservation.
          </p>
        <li>Releasing hatchlings into the ocean</li>
          <p>
            Releasing hatchlings into the ocean is a crucial step in the conservation of sea turtles. This process allows the hatchlings to make their way to the sea and begin their lives in the wild.
          </p>
        <li>Providing medical care to injured turtles</li>
          <p>
            Providing medical care to injured turtles is an essential part of sea turtle conservation. Injured turtles are treated and rehabilitated, and if they cannot be released into the wild, they are provided with a permanent home.
          </p>
        <li>Researching sea turtle behavior and ecology</li>
          <p>
            Researching sea turtle behavior and ecology is a vital aspect of sea turtle conservation. This research helps scientists understand the turtles' behavior and ecology, which is crucial in developing effective conservation strategies.
